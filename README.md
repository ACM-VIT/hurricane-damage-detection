## Overview

Idea : To identify the Flood prone areas using the Satellite images of the city

Explanation : The goal is to build a model which identifies if a given region in Texas city isthe dataset given below, likely to contain flooding damage due to Hurricane Harvey.The basic required packages can be found in requirements.txt and can be installed using the pip command given below in usage. The dataset given below consists the Satellite images of Texas city after Hurricane Harvey and are divided into two groups (Damage and No damage). OpenCV can be majorly used to extract the features in the images.TesorFlow modules can also be used for pre-processing the images and other purposes. Usual Machine Learning algorithms or even Deep Learning methods can be applied to build the required model.
